is a link:https://sonarr.tv/[Sonarr] companion script to allow the automatic downloading of web series normally not available for Sonarr to search for. Using link:https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html[Youtube-DL] it allows you to download your webseries from the list of link:https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html[supported sites].

== Features
* Downloading **Web Series** using online sources normally unavailable to Sonarr
* Ability to specify the downloaded video format globally or per series
* Downloads new episodes automatically once available
* Imports directly to Sonarr and it can then update your plex as and example
* Allows setting time offsets to handle prerelease series
* Can pass cookies.txt to handle site logins

== How do I use it

Firstly you need a series that is available online in the supported sites that YouTube-DL can grab from.
Secondly you need to add this to Sonarr and monitor the episodes that you want.
Thirdly edit your config.yml accordingly so that this knows where your Sonarr is, which series you are after and where to grab it from.
Lastly be aware that this requires the TVDB to match exactly what the episodes titles are in the scan, generally this is ok but as its an openly editable site sometime there can be differences.

== Great how do I get started

Obviously its a docker image so you need docker, if you don't know what that is you need to look into that first.

=== docker

[source,console]
----
docker create \
  --name=sonarr_youtubedl \
  -v /path/to/data:/config \
  -v /path/to/sonarrmedia:/sonarr_root \
  -v /path/to/logs:/logs \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  whatdaybob/sonarr_youtubedl
----

=== docker-compose

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.4'
services:
  sonarr_youtubedl:
    image: whatdaybob/sonarr_youtubedl
    container_name: sonarr_youtubedl
    volumes:
      - /path/to/data:/config
      - /path/to/sonarrmedia:/sonarr_root
      - /path/to/logs:/logs
----

=== Docker volumes

[Attributes]
|===
|Parameter|Function
|`-v /config`|sonarr_youtubedl configs
|`-v /sonarr_root`|Library location from Sonarr container
|`-v /logs`|Location to save logs
|===

== Configuration file

On first run the docker will create a template file in the config folder.

[source,yaml]
----
include::./config/config.yml.template[]
----

copy the `config.yml.template` to a new file called `config.yml` and edit accordingly.
